# IBM-DevOps-and-Software-Engineering-Certificate

Repo with my course work for the IBM DevOps and Software Engineering Professional Certification offered on Coursera.

The courses in this program helped me develop skill sets in a variety of DevOps philosophies and methodologies including Agile Development, Scrum Methodology, Cloud Native Architecture, Behavior and Test-Driven Development, and Zero Downtime Deployments.

The course also teaches you to program with the Python language and Linux shell scripts, create projects in GitHub,containerize and orchestrate your applications using Docker, Kubernetes & OpenShift, compose applications with microservices, employ serverless technologies, perform continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), develop testcases, ensure your code is secure, and monitor & troubleshoot your cloud deployments.
